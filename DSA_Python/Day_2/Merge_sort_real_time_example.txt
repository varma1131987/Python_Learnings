1. Sorting Stock Prices

Scenario: Stock prices or trading volumes for a specific time period need to be sorted for analysis.
Example:
Sorting daily stock prices to find trends, such as the highest or lowest prices.
Sorting trading volumes to identify the most active trading days.

2. Merging Data from Multiple Sources
Scenario: Stock market data often comes from multiple exchanges or sources, and the data needs to be merged into a single sorted dataset.
Example:
Merging stock price data from the NYSE and NASDAQ to create a unified dataset.
Combining historical data from different time periods for analysis.

3. External Sorting for Large Datasets
Scenario: Stock market data is often too large to fit into memory, requiring external sorting.
Example:
Sorting millions of stock transactions stored on disk.
Merge Sort is ideal for external sorting because it processes chunks of data and merges them efficiently.

4. Analyzing Historical Data
Scenario: Historical stock data needs to be sorted for trend analysis or backtesting trading strategies.
Example:
Sorting historical stock prices to calculate moving averages or identify patterns.
Sorting data by date to analyze trends over time.

5. Real-Time Data Processing
Scenario: In real-time trading systems, data needs to be sorted quickly for decision-making.
Example:
Sorting incoming stock prices or order book data to identify the best buy/sell opportunities.
Merge Sort can be parallelized for faster processing in real-time systems.

6. Portfolio Management
Scenario: Sorting stocks in a portfolio by performance metrics like returns or risk.
Example:
Sorting stocks by their daily percentage change to identify top gainers or losers.
Sorting by market capitalization to categorize stocks into large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap.

7. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Scenario: Preparing stock market data for machine learning or statistical analysis.
Example:
Sorting data to remove duplicates or identify missing values.
Sorting by timestamps to ensure data is in chronological order.
Advantages of Using Merge Sort for Stock Market Data
Efficiency:
Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it efficient for large datasets.
Stability:
Merge Sort is stable, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements, which is important when sorting by multiple attributes (e.g., price and timestamp).
External Sorting:
Merge Sort is well-suited for external sorting, which is often required for large stock market datasets stored on disk.
Parallelization:
Merge Sort can be parallelized, making it suitable for real-time or high-frequency trading systems.
